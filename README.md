## What I do (recent)

### Ethosphere — Software Engineer
I work on backend + full-stack systems used in production and live demos.

**Concrete stuff I shipped / owned:**
- Admin UI system end-to-end: core features, backend endpoints, auth, DB flows, CI/CD checks
- Microphone login/auth: registration + session handling + improved request flow
- Multi-tenant storage + client separation (data stays in the right tenant)
- Extended system into NRF Manager + Associate UI (full-stack integration)
- Bootstrapped deployments: infra via AWS CDK + frontend on Vercel

**What mattered (results):**
- Reliable end-to-end system: auth + sessions + data integrity stayed consistent
- Stable enough for repeated demo usage (NRF) and continued iteration
- Extensible patterns so we’re not rewriting everything per client
